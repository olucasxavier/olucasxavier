<h1>👋 Hi there, I'm Lucas! <br/></h1>

Seasoned Senior Customer Success Manager embarking on an exciting journey towards becoming a Security Architect in the realm of Cybersecurity. With nearly 3 years in the industry, my globe-trotting adventures alongside numerous MSPs have kindled a fervor for championing the boundless potential of cybersecurity.

My arsenal includes a profound understanding of network dynamics, virtualization, security frameworks, Linux landscapes, and the fine art of troubleshooting. Armed with adept communication skills, I’m not only primed to decode complex tech talk, but also adept at fostering seamless collaboration within teams and with valued clientele.

Here you can find a few projects that I've deployed around cybersecurity, I hope you enjoy it and feel free to send me a DM if interested to chat, always glad to.
